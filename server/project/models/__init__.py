"""This package contains all the models used to manipulate server data.

Modules:
    constants.py: This file contains constants that are used
    by the other classes (such as file paths)

    events.py: This file handles the events that are caused by the library,
    for example when an experiment is finished.

    experiment.py: This file defines different classes required to
    handle the progress of experiments and the experiment itself,
    which in turn has methods to run new experiments or validate them.

    experiment_queue.py: This module contains a class
    that handles the queueing of the experiments.

    mail.py: This module contains a class that is used to
    handle sending emails to the user whenever an experiment is finished.

    options_formatter.py: This contains a class and methods
    that are used to convert user experiment options
    to configuration dictionaries and vice-versa.

    result_loader.py: This module contains functions
    to load and modify data from evaluation results.

    result_storage.py: This module contains functions
    to load, save and modify data from the result overview.

classes:
    Token

methods:
    make_mail

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
